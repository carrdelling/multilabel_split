# multilabel_split
Sample algorithm for stratified train/test split in multi-label problems

Mostly for educational purposes - as some parts of the algorithm would need to be replace in a real-world setting.

The are several papers online describing similar approaches, but sadly no free implentation for large-scale datasets, to the best of my knowledge.

This specific implementation was (mostly) inpired by the following work:
